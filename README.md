# happy-number

Happy number is a number, where starting with any positive integers replace the number by the sum of squares of its digits,
this process will be repeated until it becomes 1, otherwise it will loop endlessly in a cycle. Those numbers, when the 1 has found, they will be happy number.

Suppose the number is 19, the output will be true as the number is happy number. As we can see from 19, we will get

1^2 + 9^2 = 82

8^2 + 2^2 = 68

6^2 + 8^2 = 100

1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
